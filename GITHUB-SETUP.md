# GitHub Setup Instructions

## 🚀 Repository Creation Steps

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/orgs/doitintl/repositories
2. Click "New repository"
3. Repository details:
   - **Name**: `amazon-q-aws-programs-toolkit`
   - **Description**: `Amazon Q AWS Programs Toolkit - Interactive assessment tools for MAP, OLA, and ONE OLA programs`
   - **Visibility**: Choose based on your organization's policy
   - **Initialize**: Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

### Step 2: Push Local Repository
Once the repository is created, run these commands:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/amazon-q-aws-programs

# Add the remote origin (replace with your actual repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/doitintl/amazon-q-aws-programs-toolkit.git

# Push to main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Repository
- Check that all files are uploaded
- Verify the README displays correctly
- Test the repository structure
