### Quick Updates
For quick fixes:
1. Make changes locally
2. Test with `streamlit run streamlit-prototype.py`
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. Streamlit Cloud auto-deploys from main branch

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues
1. **Requirements not found**: Ensure `requirements.txt` is in root directory
2. **App won't start**: Check main file path is `streamlit-prototype.py`
3. **Import errors**: Verify all dependencies are in requirements.txt
4. **Slow loading**: Consider optimizing large data operations

### Quick Fixes
```bash
# Update requirements
echo "streamlit>=1.28.0" > requirements.txt
echo "pandas>=1.5.0" >> requirements.txt
echo "plotly>=5.0.0" >> requirements.txt

# Test locally
streamlit run streamlit-prototype.py --server.port 8503

# Push updates
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Updated requirements"
git push
```
