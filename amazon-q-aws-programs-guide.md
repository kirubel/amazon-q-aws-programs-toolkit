## AWS Migration Acceleration Program (MAP)

### Assessment and Planning

**Capabilities:**
- Analyze existing infrastructure configurations and dependencies
- Generate migration readiness assessments
- Create detailed migration wave planning
- Identify application interdependencies and data flows

**On-Premises Scenarios:**
Amazon Q can help analyze server inventory files, identify patterns, and suggest optimal AWS mappings for various scenarios:

**Customer Use Cases:**

#### Legacy Data Center Migration
- **Scenario**: Customer with 500+ physical servers needs migration strategy
- **Q's Role**: 
  - Analyzes server specifications and utilization patterns
  - Recommends EC2 instance families and storage types
  - Suggests migration tools (AWS MGN, DMS, SCT)
  - Creates phased migration timeline

#### Multi-Cloud Environment Assessment
- **Scenario**: Customer running workloads across VMware, Hyper-V
- **Q's Role**:
  - Helps assess workload compatibility
  - Identifies containerization opportunities
  - Recommends hybrid connectivity options (Direct Connect, VPN)

### Code Modernization

**Capabilities:**
- Refactor monolithic applications to microservices
- Update legacy frameworks and dependencies
- Implement cloud-native patterns (12-factor app principles)
- Convert procedural code to event-driven architectures

**Customer Use Cases:**

#### Legacy .NET Applications
- Q analyzes existing codebase for cloud readiness
- Suggests modernization paths (lift-and-shift vs. re-architect)
- Helps implement CI/CD pipelines with CodePipeline
- Converts configuration management to Parameter Store/Secrets Manager

#### Java Enterprise Applications
- Q assists with Spring Boot migration
- Helps containerize with Docker/ECS
- Implements distributed caching with ElastiCache
- Converts JMS to SQS/SNS messaging patterns

### Infrastructure as Code

**Capabilities:**
- Generate CloudFormation templates from existing infrastructure
- Create CDK applications in multiple languages
- Build Terraform configurations for multi-cloud scenarios
- Implement GitOps workflows

**Customer Scenarios:**

#### VMware vSphere Environment Migration
- Q creates equivalent AWS infrastructure templates
- Maps vSphere resource pools to EC2 placement groups
- Converts vSphere networking to VPC configurations
- Implements equivalent backup strategies with AWS Backup

## Optimization and Licensing Assessment (OLA)

### Cost Analysis and Optimization

**Capabilities:**
- Compare on-premises TCO with AWS costs
- Analyze current licensing spend and utilization
- Model different AWS pricing options (On-Demand, Reserved, Savings Plans)
- Calculate migration ROI and payback periods

**Customer Use Cases:**

#### Enterprise Data Center Cost Analysis
- **Scenario**: Customer spending $2M annually on hardware refresh
- **Q's Analysis**:
  - Analyzes current utilization patterns
  - Models AWS costs with right-sizing recommendations
  - Calculates 3-year TCO comparison
  - Identifies cost optimization opportunities

### Right-sizing Recommendations

**Capabilities:**
- Analyze performance metrics and usage patterns
- Recommend optimal instance types and sizes
- Suggest auto-scaling configurations
- Identify over-provisioned resources

### License Optimization Strategies

**BYOL vs License-Included Analysis:**
- SQL Server: Compare BYOL with RDS License Included
- Windows Server: Analyze Hybrid Benefit opportunities
- Oracle: Evaluate dedicated hosts vs. RDS options
- Red Hat: Compare BYOL with RHEL on AWS

## ONE OLA: Windows Server and Storage Specializations

### Windows Server Optimization

**Assessment Capabilities:**
- Analyze Windows Server versions and edition requirements
- Evaluate Active Directory integration needs
- Assess .NET Framework dependencies
- Review Windows-specific features usage

**Migration Scenarios:**

#### Windows Server 2012 R2 End-of-Support
- **Customer Use Case**: 200 Windows Server 2012 R2 instances
- **Q's Analysis**:
  - Analyzes application dependencies
  - Recommends migration to EC2 with Windows Server 2022
  - Calculates Hybrid Benefit savings (up to 40% cost reduction)
  - Suggests modernization paths for suitable workloads

#### Active Directory Migration
**Optimization Strategies:**
- **Hybrid Identity**: AWS Managed Microsoft AD vs. AD Connector
- **Authentication**: Integration with AWS SSO and IAM
- **Group Policy**: Transition to AWS Systems Manager for configuration management

### Storage Specializations

**Storage Assessment Framework:**

#### File Server Modernization
Traditional File Server migration to:
- FSx for Windows File Server (SMB/CIFS)
- FSx for Lustre (HPC workloads)
- FSx for NetApp ONTAP (enterprise features)

**Customer Scenarios:**

#### Windows File Server Consolidation
- **Current State**: 50 Windows file servers, 500TB total storage
- **Q's Analysis**:
  - Maps file shares to FSx for Windows File Server
  - Calculates storage tiering opportunities
  - Recommends backup strategy with AWS Backup
  - Estimates 60% cost reduction vs. traditional SAN storage

#### SQL Server Storage Optimization
- **Current**: Traditional SAN with 10K RPM drives
- **Recommended**: gp3 volumes with optimized IOPS/throughput
- **Cost savings**: 40-50% vs. traditional storage arrays

**Storage Migration Strategies:**
- **Lift and Shift**: Direct migration to EBS volumes
- **Modernization**: Transition to managed services (RDS, Aurora)
- **Hybrid**: AWS Storage Gateway for gradual migration

#### Enterprise Backup Modernization
- **Current**: Tape-based backup system, 14-day retention
- **Q's Recommendation**:
  - AWS Backup for operational recovery
  - S3 Glacier for long-term retention
  - Cross-region replication for disaster recovery
  - Cost reduction: 70% vs. traditional tape infrastructure

### Windows Licensing Optimization

**Hybrid Benefit Analysis:**
- Windows Server Standard: 2 VMs per license
- Windows Server Datacenter: Unlimited VMs per license
- Example: 100 Windows VMs can achieve 40% savings with Hybrid Benefit

**SQL Server Licensing Strategies:**
- **License Mobility**: Move existing SQL licenses to EC2
- **RDS License Included**: Compare with BYOL options
- **Dedicated Hosts**: For compliance requirements
